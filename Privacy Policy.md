**First Stop Extension Privacy Policy**

Last updated: 4th August 2024

------
**Intro**

This privacy policy contains the principles of how First Stop handles your data. 

------
**Type of Data Handled**

First Stop handles the search queries performed on the extension's search mechanism. However, such queries are not collected nor stored separately. First Stop only passes such queries to the third party website to allow the search to be performed on that particular third party. Because of this, none of such search queries can be sold to third parties.

------
**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

I may update this privacy policy from time to time. I will notify the First Stop users of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.

When a new version of the privacy policy is published, I will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this privacy policy.

First Stop users are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
